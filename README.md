to add an employee you need to enter the employee's name, as well as their Amazon ID (8 characters) and any training they currently possess.

in the "update training" field you will need their Amazon ID (8 characters) and the new training they have received.

In the "add work" field you will need to better their Amazon ID and the area they will be assigned to work. it will check their training to make sure they have the required training for the position assigned.
